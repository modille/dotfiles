# Capitalized, short (50 chars or less) summary
#
# More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72
# characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
# subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank
# line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
# the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the
# two together.
